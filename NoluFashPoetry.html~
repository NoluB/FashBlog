<div class="column">
<h2>What My Soul Has Met</h2>
<p>Pondering On What To Think About.</p>
<p> What To Talk About.</p>
<p> Lazy Days Have My Eyes Shut With Vivid Carvings Of He Standing Tall In My Path .</p>
<p>The One Who Holds Half Of Me.</p>
<p> His Soul Meant To InterTwine With She.</p>
<p> His thoughts I Can Read.</p>
<p>His Lips I Can Taste.</p>
<p> His Hands I Can Touch. </p>
<p>His Body I can Feel. </p>
<p>His Breath Heavy On My Chest.</p> 
<p>Our Feet Touch . </p>
<p>We Don't Talk Much - The Heart Felt Conversations I Have With He, Are Interpreted By The Sound Of My Heart Beating Heavily On My Chest.</p> <p>Even Though My Eyes Haven't Seen. My Heart Has Felt What My Soul Has Met.</p>
</div>

<div class="column">
    <h2>You</h2>
<p>Chocolate dipped skin.</p>
<p>Honey like taste.</p>
<p>Sweet and sour my taste_buds are hooked.</p>
<p> Your stance glows euphoric scriptures.</p>
<p> Pictures of your movement shot in every angle.</p> 
I'm Amazed at how you make the hills of my lips move up and down traveling the road of laughter and happy smiles.</p>
<p>Heartfelt innocence.</p>
<p>As your eyes glaze up and glance at me then a wink, and a kiss to seal what was left opened for public display.
Let's compass this affection, turn me north. 
Let's go left before we flow towards right. 
Rotate - u spin me till infinity!
The Sun shines through my wide cravings for you. Your shadows live me wanting more.
You lead me to soul digging, love making, headache creating, eye-brow raising, pleasing expeditions.
We need not pay attentions to daily inhibitions.
Oh but the secrete passage ways we've created need not be found. 
Grasping at the reality we have created I'm left word less. *sigh*. 
My dry lips are a neon indication of needing' some you loving
You call I "my heart" as I apparently linger in the inner walls of your inside. 
I do how ever ponder as to what I may call you. 
So I settle for "my enigma" as we is indescribable.
Unattainable.Unreachable.</p> 
<p>We put up "PLEASE DO NOT DISTURB!"signs frequently.</p> 
<p>Your my hotel room service, 5star your love reigns. 
Addicted iam. Withdrawals have me blinded to your impurity.</p> 
<p>All I know is I NEED YOU</p>
  </div>
<div class="column">
    <h2>My LIGHT</h2>
    <p>The world is too much with me</p>
<p>These heavy burdens. They all deeply rooted to Eden.</p>
<p> Adam & Eva what have u brought upon my soul.</p>
<p> Where is my heaven? Heavenly.</p> 
<p>I subscribe to sun shiny days to turn a blind eye to my stormy, winds hurling, earthquake shaking, tornado twisting deep within kind of days.</p>
<p>You see its like ah playing a record backwards. Need I walk backwards? And the voices of the voiceless squealing silently.</p>
<p>Trembling.</p>
<p> He seeks my soul in the shadows of darkness. I close my eyes to blind myself to the never ending bitter images I have come to know. This world is no longer my own. My kind soul feels weakened by the darkness. Darkness it seems to consume, digest and spit out everything it senses on its path. I'm alone. I'm afraid. I'm not strong enough to fight these dark twisted pen drawn images.</p>
<p>Trembling.</p>
<p>I carry on my search for purity. True Kindness. These words I hear sting. The things I taste are tasteless, no longer do my taste buds dance to the first kiss of happiness. This darkness consumes thy soul. Just as I have lost all hope, with my tears falling on the dusty ground, the clouds run way from my tears. My heart throbs.</p> 
<p>As I look up and see that my light is here, you.</p>
</p>

  <div class="column">
    <h1>Goodbye Fire</h1>
<p>You appear to me as an illusion.</p>
<p>A manifestation of what my heart & soul has been searching for, yearning for, waiting for, dreaming off.</p>
<p>So elusive, mysterious , unattainable. Dancing wildly in front of me like a fire that's going out of control.</p>
<p>Like a kid with a pocket full of candy im excited by this image tempted to touch, feel & hold u but my fear of getting burnt restricts me.</p>
<p>I see sparks.</p>
<p>As flashes of your being possess my inner thoughts. I can't quite pen u down, nor can I track u down. I fail to grasp at what ever it is your doing to me.</p>

<p>But before I touch you fire, I come back to my senses.</p>
<p> I'm not trying to be mesmerised by your essence.</p>
<p>No matter how pleasant you are, my world doesn't revolve around you.</p>
<p>And so I refuse to fall, not on the ground & definitely not for you.</p>
<p>I put you out with my last words being -</p>

<p>Goodbye Fire.</p>
